Conclusions:

We observed 3 trends over the 45 Days of the study on 249 mice from "Pymaceuticals Inc"; The main goal of this study is to check/compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, i.e. Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

1)	The Capomulin drug regimen in comparison with the others like Ramicane is showing equal results if not slightly greater average tumor volume (mm3); Capomulin showing 40.6 mm3 and Ramicane showing average tumor volume of 40.2. 
2)	Ketapril seemed to be the worse drug candidate [average tumor volume is at 55.2 mm3] of the lowest drug treatments per the bar chart. There is not really a great difference on the mouse gender [whether the mouse was female or male] to determine if the drug treatments made a difference either. 
3)	The correlation between mouse weight, and average tumor volume is 0.84. It is a strong positive correlation, when the mouse weight increases the average tumor volume also increases i.e. mouse weight is directly proportionate to average tumor volume.
4)	While most drugs caused tumor volumes to increase with time, Capomulin and Ramicane were the only ones effective at reducing or containing the tumor volumes
